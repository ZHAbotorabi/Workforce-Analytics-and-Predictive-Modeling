# Workforce Analytics and Predictive Modeling

This project encompasses:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover patterns and trends in employee behavior using visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts, scatterplots) to analyze correlations and detect outliers.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Transform raw data into meaningful insights by creating derived or interaction features, such as:
  - `Absenteeism Frequency` using the `Date` feature and total absenteeism hours.  
  - Combining `Children` and `Pets` to assess familial responsibilities.  
  - Categorizing `Daily Work Load Average` into light, moderate, or heavy levels.  
- **Predictive Modeling and Classification:** Develop regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict absenteeism hours and classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) to categorize absenteeism levels as Low, Medium, or High.  
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Identify key predictors like Distance to Work or BMI and propose actionable strategies such as:
  - Flexible work options for employees with long commutes.  
  - Health and wellness programs for individuals with high BMI.  
  - Childcare facilities to support employees with familial responsibilities.  

The projectâ€™s focus is on leveraging **Feature Engineering**, data analysis, and machine learning to enhance workforce efficiency and decision-making.
