        "# Industrial Absenteeism Project\n",
        "This project is to analyze the factors contributing to absenteeism in the workplace and develop a predictive model to identify employees at risk of high absenteeism.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dataset Overview\n",
        "- ID: Unique identifier for employees.\n",
        "- Reason for Absence: Categorical variable indicating the reason for absenteeism.\n",
        "- Date: Date of absenteeism.\n",
        "- Transportation Expense: Cost incurred for transportation.\n",
        "- Distance to Work: Distance between home and workplace.\n",
        "- Age: Age of the employee.\n",
        "- Daily Work Load Average: Average workload of the employee.\n",
        "- Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI of the employee.\n",
        "- Education: Education level (categorical).\n",
        "- Children: Number of children the employee has.\n",
        "- Pets: Number of pets the employee has.\n",
        "- Absenteeism Time in Hours: Target variable indicating hours of absence.\n",

        "#### Steps to Design the Project\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Problem Understanding**\n",
        "   - Define the problem: Analyze absenteeism and its causes to mitigate its impact on productivity.\n",
        "   - Target variable: `Absenteeism Time in Hours`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
        "   - Handle missing values if present.\n",
        "   - Transform the `Date` feature:\n",
        "     - Extract `Year`, `Month`, `Day of the Week`, and `Holiday/Workday` indicators.\n",
        "   - Group `Reason for Absence` into broader categories:\n",
        "     - Health-related issues, Family responsibilities, Transportation issues, Others.\n",
        "   - Scale numerical features like `Transportation Expense`, `Distance to Work`, and `Daily Work Load Average`.\n",
        "   - Encode categorical variables (`Education`, `Reason for Absence`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
        "   - Use visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, scatterplots) to:\n",
        "     - Explore correlations between features and absenteeism.\n",
        "     - Identify trends based on Age, Reason for Absence, and Education level.\n",
        "   - Detect and handle outliers in numerical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Feature Engineering**\n",
        "   - Create derived features:\n",
        "     - `Absenteeism Frequency` using the `Date` feature and total absenteeism hours.\n",
        "     - Categorize `Daily Work Load Average` (e.g., light, moderate, heavy).\n",
        "   - Build interaction features:\n",
        "     - Combine `Children` and `Pets` for familial responsibilities.\n",
        "     - Analyze the impact of `Transportation Expense` and `Distance to Work`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Development**\n",
        "   - Use regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict `Absenteeism Time in Hours`.\n",
        "   - For classification, define absenteeism levels (Low, Medium, High) and use models like Logistic Regression or SVM.\n",
        "   - Evaluate models using:\n",
        "     - Regression: MAE, RMSE.\n",
        "     - Classification: F1-score, Accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Insights and Recommendations**\n",
        "   - Identify significant predictors such as Distance to Work, BMI, or specific Reasons for Absence.\n",
        "   - Provide recommendations:\n",
        "     - Introduce flexible work options for long commutes.\n",
        "     - Launch health and wellness programs for employees with high BMI.\n",
        "     - Offer childcare facilities for employees with family responsibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Deployment**\n",
        "   - Develop a dashboard (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask) for HR teams to:\n",
        "     - Monitor absenteeism trends.\n",
        "     - Receive alerts for employees at high risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Expected Outcomes\n",
        "- Comprehensive understanding of absenteeism patterns.\n",
        "- Targeted strategies to reduce absenteeism.\n",
        "- A predictive model for proactive absenteeism management.\n"
